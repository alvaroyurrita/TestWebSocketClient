# TestWebsockets

This is the ButtonDriven Branch

ButtonDriven: This is use to test each step needed to set up an RxJs server, to send different types of messages, and to try different ways to close the client

The client can be run locally using Angular's ng serve command, or it can be run on a server using the ng build command to create a dist folder that can be served by a web server.
